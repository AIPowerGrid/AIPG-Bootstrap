# AIPG Bootstrap

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Latest Release:**
   - Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/AIPowerGrid/AIPG-Bootstrap/releases).
   - Download the latest `.zip` source file.

2. **Extract the Zip File:**
   - Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file.

    **WARNING: Before proceeding to the next step, ensure that your wallet is closed.**

3. **Getting the wallet ready for the bootstrap:**
   - Open the `AIPG-Bootstrap-*` folder.
   - Run `AIPG-folder-location.bat`, this will pop up the AIPG wallet folder location.
   - Create a folder named `databackup` inside the AIPG wallet folder location and move all files and folders (except `wallet.dat`) into it.
   - You should be left with just the databackup folder and wallet.dat file inside the AIPG folder.
   - Set aside the Aipg folder.

4. **Extract `bootstrap.zip` to Aipg Folder:**
   - In the `AIPG-Bootstrap-*` folder, double click on `bootstrap.zip`.
   - Copy the contents to the Aipg folder (not in the backup folder).

5. **Run Your Wallet:**
   - You can now run your wallet.
   - Your wallet will benefit from a head start on blocks, and the synchronization process should be significantly faster.
   - Once your wallet is fully synched, then you can remove the `databackup` folder created earlier. (Dont delete your `wallet.dat` file by accident, that would suck.)
